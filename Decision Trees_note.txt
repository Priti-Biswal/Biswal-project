Decession tree is clasification problem solving algoritham.
It arranges the data in the form of a tree and take the decession from there.

Donot look into the whole data as one a group.devedied into subset.so that we can decession easyly.

we are going to calculate information gain. 


Impurity measure:
Entropy is calculated for a segment , it is measure of impurity.

 Entropy=-p1 log2 p1 - p2 log2 p2
 
 
 Model built on train data and validate on test data.
 
 the model works very well on train data( very accuracy on trian data) but if there is any significant difference
 in test data then it is called overfitting.
  
  for exampl train data accuracy is 85% and test data is 50% then it is overfitting issue.
  
  If the accuracy is significant different between the train and test data called overfitting.
  
  if the train data acurracy is too low then it is underfitting.
  if the max depth of the tree is too low then it leads to underfitting.
  If the max depth of the tree is too high then it leads to overfitting
  
  we can avoid the overfitting by using pruning paramert.
  (one of the pruning paramert is maxdepth,max leafe node)
  
  finalize the model by highest acurracy on train and matching accuracy on test data.
